EZ kick people off wifi.

Basically you kick people off wifi, i got this idea from wifikill and netcut (android and windows), so i decided to make one for Linux :)
Feel free to use it but don't be jerk and re-do it or steal it.

In case you want to share it or edit-publish, contact me @ linuxmetters@gmail.com, or mention SHUXPROJECT : ) thats all am askin for.
